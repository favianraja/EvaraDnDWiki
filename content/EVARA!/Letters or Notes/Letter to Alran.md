My Dearest [[Alran Crimsonveil]],

I don’t know if this will ever reach you. Maybe you won’t care. Maybe you already forgot us the moment you stepped back into the Silver Quarters, where sickness doesn’t exist and grief is unfashionable.

She asked for you, you know. Every morning, before the cough took her voice. “Where’s father?” she whispered. “Did he take the stars with him?”

I held her hand until the end. I still hear her laugh in the walls. I still tuck in her pillow at night. I still forget she’s gone when I pass by the door.

I wasn’t going to do it. But then he came — a man in a dark cloak, no name, no voice. He left a book on our doorstep and said only one thing:

“She is not lost. Just misplaced.”

I haven’t opened it yet. It feels... alive. It hums when I touch the cover. I see flickers of her in the corners when I pass the bookshelf. I don’t care if it’s cursed. If it gives me one more second with her — even one — I’ll pay whatever price it asks.

I just wish you were brave enough to say goodbye.**
